        <p>2020 seemed like a complete disaster. It had a major impact on the economy, and also on the educational system. Teachers and students had to resort to remote learning, which in the beggining, seemed like an unfortunate burden. However, was this really a cure to the problems our educational system has been plagued with for so long? For years before the pandemic, scientists argued that students were getting improper sleep. This remote learning seemed to take that problem away in an instant. The burden of transportation was cleaned off the long list of problems, and allowed students to get a lot more well-deserved sleep.</p>

              <p> Our school adresses this directly. For next year we plan to give students a voice. Students will the option to work from the comfort of their homes, which teachers believe is a far less stressful environment that promotes comfort and learning. Given this option, we expect nothing but the best from out students. We are one of the only schools adressing this problem directly, because we want to give STUDENTS A VOICE. </p>
